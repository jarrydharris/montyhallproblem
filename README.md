# Monty Hall Problem

## Demo:
https://themontyhallproblem.herokuapp.com/ (Only works on Laptops/PCs/Tablets, optimizing for phones is a WIP)

## Description:
This project was for a science communication unit. The task was to create media of any form about a topic we had knowledge of. I was also looking for a project to learn [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [scrollama](https://pudding.cool/process/introducing-scrollama/) so I figured why not describe the monty hall problem as an interactive story. This is my first project in JavaScript and is still currently a work in progress, to meet the deadline of the assignment I produced a minimum viable product that works on larger screens. After feedback from testers I've identified a few changes I'd like to make: Optimize for phone screens, make the interactivity more obvious, improve the artwork and the animated graph.
